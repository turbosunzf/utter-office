# Multica Mobile (iOS)

Expo + React Native iOS client for Multica. Independent from web/desktop — shares only types from `@multica/core/`. See [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) for the locked tech-stack baseline and import rules.

## Just want to use it on your phone? (no development)

Multica isn't on the App Store yet — until that changes, anyone who wants it on their iPhone builds from source. One command:

```bash
pnpm ios:mobile:device:prod:release
```

This connects to the same backend as `multica.ai`, so your existing account just works.

**Prerequisites**: Mac with Xcode, a free Apple ID added under Xcode → Settings → Accounts, iPhone connected via USB with [Developer Mode enabled](https://docs.expo.dev/guides/ios-developer-mode/). Walk through Expo's [Set up your environment](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/) (pick **Development build → iOS Device**) if any of that is missing.

Xcode signs the build with the "Personal Team" your Apple ID automatically owns — created silently the first time you signed into Xcode, no setup needed. The first build downloads CocoaPods + compiles React Native from source — expect 10–20 minutes. Subsequent builds reuse Xcode's cache.

**If Xcode rejects signing with "No matching provisioning profiles found"** — rare, happens if someone has claimed the default bundle id `ai.multica.mobile` on Apple's developer portal. Pick any reverse-domain you own and re-run:

```bash
export EXPO_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER_PROD=com.yourname.multica
pnpm ios:mobile:device:prod:release
```

**7-day signing limit**: a free Apple ID signs builds for 7 days. After that, plug back into the Mac and re-run the command to re-sign. An Apple Developer Program account ($99/yr) extends this to 1 year.

Everything below is for app developers — you can ignore the rest if you only wanted a personal install.

## Scripts

| Command | What it does | Backend |
|---|---|---|
| `pnpm dev:mobile` | Metro only (reuse existing install) | local (`.env.development.local`) |
| `pnpm dev:mobile:staging` | Metro only (reuse existing install) | staging (`.env.staging`) |
| `pnpm dev:mobile:prod` | Metro only (reuse existing install) | production (`.env.production`) |
| `pnpm ios:mobile` | Full rebuild + install on **iOS Simulator**, Debug | local |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:staging` | Full rebuild + install on **iOS Simulator**, Debug | staging |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:prod` | Full rebuild + install on **iOS Simulator**, Debug | production |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:device` | Full rebuild + install on **USB iPhone**, Debug | local |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:device:staging` | Full rebuild + install on **USB iPhone**, Debug | staging |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:device:staging:release` | Full rebuild + install on **USB iPhone**, Release (standalone) | staging |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:device:prod` | Full rebuild + install on **USB iPhone**, Debug | production |
| `pnpm ios:mobile:device:prod:release` | Full rebuild + install on **USB iPhone**, Release (standalone) | production |

`dev:*` runs Metro only — assumes the matching variant is already installed. `ios:mobile*` does a full native rebuild + install.

Bundle id and display name switch on `APP_ENV` (see `app.config.ts`), so Dev / Staging / Production variants can coexist on the same device or simulator.

## First-time setup

`.env.staging` is committed (public staging URL). `.env.development.local` is gitignored — copy the template once:

```bash
cp apps/mobile/.env.example apps/mobile/.env.development.local
# then edit EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL inside it to your Mac's LAN IP, e.g. http://192.168.1.42:8080
```

If your Apple ID isn't on the Multica Apple Developer team yet, also uncomment and set `EXPO_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER_DEV` to a reverse-domain you own (e.g. `com.yourname.multica.dev`). This **only** overrides the dev variant — staging / production bundle ids are intentionally not overridable so variants can coexist.

## Build it onto your iPhone

Two paths, depending on what you want to do:

### Day-to-day development (Mac in front of you)

```bash
pnpm ios:mobile:device:staging
```

Produces a **Debug build** with `expo-dev-launcher` embedded. Every launch the app probes Metro on your Mac and pulls fresh JS — perfect for hot-reload, painful when the Mac is asleep or you're on a different WiFi.

### Standalone / "just use it" (walk away from the Mac)

```bash
pnpm ios:mobile:device:staging:release
```

Produces a **Release build**. No `expo-dev-launcher`, no Metro probe, no "Downloading…" screen. Splash → app, exactly like an App Store install. Trade-off: every JS change requires re-running this command.

Both paths share the same prerequisites: Mac with Xcode, free Apple ID added under Xcode → Settings → Accounts, iPhone connected via USB with Developer Mode enabled. Follow Expo's [Set up your environment](https://docs.expo.dev/get-started/set-up-your-environment/) — pick **Development build → iOS Device** — if any of that is missing.

First build of either variant downloads CocoaPods + compiles React Native from source — expect 10-20 minutes. Subsequent builds reuse Xcode's DerivedData cache.

## Try it in the iOS Simulator (no iPhone needed)

```bash
pnpm ios:mobile:staging
```

Boots the simulator, builds, installs the dev-client. Faster to iterate than a device build because no signing / provisioning step. Same `dev:mobile:staging` Metro flow afterward.

## 7-day signing limit (device only)

A free Apple ID signs builds for **7 days only**, Debug and Release both. After that the app refuses to launch on the iPhone. Plug back into the Mac and re-run the corresponding `ios:mobile:device*` script to re-sign. Simulator builds are unaffected. The only workaround for the device limit is an Apple Developer Program account ($99/yr), which extends to 1 year.

## Pointing at a different backend

Edit `EXPO_PUBLIC_API_URL` in `.env.staging`, `.env.production`, or `.env.development.local` (whichever variant you're running). Then:

- For an installed **Debug build**: restart Metro (`pnpm dev:mobile:staging`) so the next JS bundle picks up the new value.
- For an installed **Release build**: re-run the `ios:mobile:device:staging:release` command — the value is baked into the embedded bundle at build time.

For local backend testing, use your Mac's LAN IP (`ipconfig getifaddr en0`), not `localhost`.

## Android

Android builds mirror the iOS flow but skip the signing gymnastics — `expo run:android` signs with the local **debug keystore**, so a release build installs straight onto any USB phone with USB debugging enabled. No Apple ID, no provisioning profile, no 7-day limit.

### Standalone / "just use it" (walk away from the Mac)

```bash
pnpm android:device:release
```

Builds a **Release APK** for the dev variant (package `com.utteroffice.mobile`, backend `https://api.multica.ai`), installs it on the connected phone via `adb`, and launches it. No Metro, no dev-launcher screen — splash → app, like an App Store install. Every JS change requires re-running the command.

### Day-to-day development (Mac in front of you)

```bash
pnpm android:device
```

Builds a **Debug** dev-client and installs it. Every launch probes Metro on your Mac and pulls fresh JS — hot-reload included, but it needs the Mac reachable over the same WiFi.

### Variants

| Command | Variant | Package |
|---|---|---|
| `pnpm android:device` | dev Debug | `com.utteroffice.mobile` |
| `pnpm android:device:release` | dev Release | `com.utteroffice.mobile` |
| `pnpm android:device:staging:release` | staging Release | `ai.multica.mobile.staging` |
| `pnpm android:device:prod:release` | production Release | `ai.multica.mobile` |

### Prerequisites

- **Android SDK** at `~/Library/Android/sdk` — keep `apps/mobile/android/local.properties` with `sdk.dir` (created by a first `expo run:android`).
- **NDK 27.0** — Expo/RN default to NDK 27.1, which isn't fully installed on this Mac, so `app.config.ts` pins `27.0.12077973` via a config plugin (`withAndroidNdkVersion`). Harmless on machines where 27.1 is properly installed.
- **USB debugging** enabled on the phone; `adb devices` should list it as `device`.
- First build downloads Gradle 9 + native dependencies — expect 10–30 min. Later builds reuse the Gradle cache.

### Notes

- Release APKs are signed with `android/app/debug.keystore` — fine for personal installs, not for Play Store distribution. Publishing needs a real `release.keystore`.
- `apps/mobile/android/` is gitignored (Expo prebuild output). Switching variants re-syncs it automatically via `expo run:android` (package name switches per `APP_ENV`, see `app.config.ts`).
- `android:device:staging:release` / `android:device:prod:release` first need real API URLs in `.env.staging` / `.env.production` — both are placeholders right now (same as the iOS equivalents).
